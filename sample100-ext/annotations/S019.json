Original study considered it as 1-bar but I think it is 2-bar because the vocal note runs slightly into the second bar or every first occurrence of the sample, but is noticeably cut off on every second occurrence, so I annotated both just in case. Sample track: L1 absence, L2 first occurrence of 1-bar sample, L3 first occurrence of 2-bar sample."}
