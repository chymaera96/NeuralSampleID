Given that the bars are exactly the same (at least to the listener), you could also assume one single bar is sampled. I annotated both versions to give both options - in the ref track, L1 gives the first occurrence of the riff as a 2-bar section and L2 gives the first occurrence as a 1-bar section. In the sample track, L1 indicates absence of track, L2 indicates first occurrence of 2-bar section, and L3 gives first occurrence of 1-bar section."}
