L1 first WITHOUT sung vocal (because this one is sampled earlier in the project). Two major issues \u2013 between the ref track and sample track, the vocal is removed and the guitar chord rhythm is different. The timestamp on the initial study does not seem to correspond to anything \u2013 just two guitar chords which are not really heard in the sample track in isolation. I think this has been rerecorded so this one might be best to leave out of the study"}
