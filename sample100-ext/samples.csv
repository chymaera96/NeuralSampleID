S001,T002,T001,0,0,19,1.03,drums/bass,other/vocals,riff,no, starts counted (sample ABCD looped ABCBCBCD). guitar in target
S002,T003,T004,0,0,4,0.95,bass/other,vocals/other,riff,no, intro. piano in target
S003,T003,T004,34,53,3,1.0,other/drums/bass,vocals/other/bass?,riff,no, refrain with horns
S004,T005,T006,0,37,60,1.0,drums,vocals/bass/other/drums?,beat,no, sample is 4 beats - sample runs 8th quaver to 8th quaver for cleaner separation of notes
S005,T007,T008,53,0,10,1.0,bass/drums/other,vocals,riff,no, (very clean: same pitch and only layer). full and partial repetitions. guitar in target. piano in target
S006,T010,T009,0,1,37,1.08,drums,vocals/other,beat,no, probably samples both bars (with two decks?). interfering guitar
S007,T011,T012,1,0,85,1.17,drums/other/vocals,vocals/drums/bass/other,riff,no, pitch shifted (sample a bit gated in the end). In ref track riff can either be interpreted as 1 bar long or 2 bars long - the two bars are exactly the same. but judging by the N repetitions = 37 as indicated in the original study I think the sample was originally interpreted as 1x 2-bar section. Given that the bars are exactly the same (at least to the listener) you could also assume one single bar is sampled. guitar in target
S008,T014,T013,74,5,10,1.05,other/bass/drums,vocals/drums/other/bass,riff,maybe, pitch shifted - beginning of riff counted (rest 'chopped')
S009,T015,T016,0,3,37,1.04,bass/other,other/vocals/drums,riff,yes, interpolation or other version. guitar in target
S010,T018,T017,0,0,1,1.0,drums/other,,riff,no, pitch shifted down - once at the start
S012,T021,T020,0,0,38,0.97,drums/bass/other,vocals/other,riff,maybe, time sampled unclear (0:00 or 2:25?)
S013,T023,T022,1,10,51,1.15,drums/other,vocals/drums/bass/other?,riff,maybe, piano in target. Same as S007 (2 bars are the same - previous study interprets as 2 bars)
S014,T025,T024,0,21,37,1.05,drums/bass/other,vocals/other/drums?,riff,no, pitch shifted up. piano in target
S015,T027,T026,5,12,38,1.02,other/drums/bass,vocals/drums/other,riff,no, pitch shifted. guitar in target
S016,T029,T028,0,37,50,1.03,bass/synth/other,drums/other/vocals/,riff,no, please note the sample is 8 quavers long but starts one quaver before the main bar and ends one quaver before the main bar ends - this is because the note heard in the sample corresponds to the note heard just before the main bar but not the one heard at the end of the main bar
S017,T031,T030,8,10,43,1.12,drums/bass/other,vocals/drums/other,riff,no, first half of loop
S018,T033,T032,1,18,217,1.0,drums/other,bass/vocals/other/drums,beat,probably not, (samples 2nd measure hence short and no melody). riff is only 2 beats repeated - used notes 2 and 3 because this was the cleanest way to get separation between the bass drum and snare because of fast rhythm starting and ending on a full beat rather than an offbeat
S019,T035,T034,40,10,48,1.0,drums/vocals/other/bass,drums/vocals/other,riff,no, (vocals). Original study considered it as 1-bar but I think it is 2-bar because the vocal note runs slightly into the second bar or every first occurrence of the sample - but is noticeably cut off on every second occurrence - so annotated both just in case
S020,T033,T036,0,2,33,1.0,drums/other/bass,other/vocals/drums,riff,no, 
S021,T038,T037,0,0,50,1.0,bass/other,vocals/other/drums,riff,no, the guitar bar
S022,T043,T037,141,26,22,1.04,bass/drums/other,vocals/bass/drums/other,riff,maybe, the outstanding melody is whistled
S023,T040,T039,0,2,21,0.94,other/drums/vocals,vocals/drums,riff,yes, clear interpolation. L1 gives original 3.5-bar sample with gaps. L2 extends this to a 4-bar sample. Please note the last couple of beats of the original 4-bar sequence are different to what is heard in the sample track which is why I gave both versions
S024,T042,T041,0,4,40,1.26,other,drums/vocals/bass/other,riff,no, the guitar bar. guitar in target. (many occurrences are cut slightly short)
S025,T045,T044,0,39,67,1.0,other/drums,bass/drums/vocals/other,riff,no, very soft and hard to count
S027,T049,T048,0,9,25,0.9,drums/bass/other,vocals/drums/other,riff,no, pitch shifted down
S028,T050,T048,0,0,19,1.04,drums/bass/other/vocals,drums,riff,no, half samples not counted (second halves)
S029,T052,T051,0,10,85,1.0,drums,bass/vocals/other,beat,no, only the measures with single BD counted. New annotations contain both samples within S124
S030,T052,T039,0,13,76,0.95,drums,vocals/other,beat,no, 
S031,T052,T037,0,4,110,1.22,drums,vocals/other/bass/drums,beat,maybe, BD filtered out or replay
S032,T052,T053,1,20,147,1.0,drums,vocals/drums/other,beat,maybe, HH filtered out or replay
S033,T045,T054,0,12,92,0.97,drums/other,vocals/drums/other/bass,1-note,no, 
S035,T056,T057,3,6,44,1.0,drums/other/vocals/bass,vocals/other,riff,no, hard to tell which parts have been sampled due to differences in voices
S036,T058,T059,5,10,26,1.04,drums/other,vocals/other/bass/drums,riff,maybe, Short sample � intro not counted
S037,T060,T061,63,63,3,1.04,vocals/other,vocals/other/bass/drums,riff,no, vocals only
S038,T062,T063,35,1,5,1.0,drums/vocals/other,bass/other/drums,riff,no, refrain w/ vocals (long). Sample includes echo of word “bad” so runs from second quaver of bar to second quaver
S039,T064,T065,25,22,157,1.3,drums/other/bass,vocals/bass/other,riff,no, the flute verse - pitch shifted up
S040,T066,T067,7,18,34,1.3,other/vocals/drums/bass,vocals/drums/bass/other,riff,no, both instr/vocal instr parts chopped?. please note there are gaps between occurrences of the samples because the four bar “phrase” is not sampled in full
S041,T068,T069,6,13,23,1.09,drums/vocals/bass?/other?,vocals/drums/bass/other,riff,maybe, nice and long (11 seconds)
S042,T070,T071,0,0,38,0.95,other/drums/bass,vocals/other,riff,no, 
S043,T072,T073,0,5,55,0.96,other,drums/vocals/bass,riff,no, piano part. Sampled section is only one bar – riff used in sample track is two bars consisting of full sampled section - then first half of the bar played twice. In other words -8 beats- consisting of beats 1 2 3 4 1 2 1 2 from the sampled section in the ref track
S044,T074,T075,7,8,79,1.0,vocals/other/drums/bass,vocals/drums/other/bass,riff,no, Short alternates full/half sample - they managed to extract vocals from the target original (Vocal has been scrubbed from sample)
S045,T076,T077,32,0,143,0.87,other/drums/bass,bass/drums/vocals,riff,no, Only 8 note string riff counted. Multiple variations of this sample are heard throughout the track sometimes being played in full sometimes just playing repeated sampled sections of two notes 
S046,T078,T079,4,2,151,0.75,other/drums/bass,vocals/drums/bass/other,1-note,no, Less than one second. 1-2 notes (hard to hear if it’s one note repeated or one long note)
S047,T080,T081,3,20,15,1.0,other/bass,drums/vocals/other,riff,no, Only repetitions of string riff counted
S048,T082,T048,2,0,68,0.84,drums,vocals/other/bass,beat,no, Beat repeated without gaps through entire track
S049,T083,T054,321,12,80,1.0,drums,vocals/other,beat,maybe, two one-bar samples are very similar but the second one does not have the guitar chord at the beginning. I think it is likely this bar was used but the original annotation says it was the first.
S050,T085,T084,1,0,45,1.04,drums,bass/other/vocals,beat,probably, 2 bar beat - 2 versions
S051,T116,T086,88,20,80,0.87,drums,other/vocals/bass,beat,no, 
S052,T088,T086,1,179,3,1.0,drums,other/vocals,beat,no, 
S054,T090,T091,0,3,91,1.07,drums,vocals/other,beat,no, 
S055,T090,T092,0,0,101,1.08,drums,bass/other/vocals,beat,no, Sample is 5 quavers padded then padded with 3 extra quavers of rest
S056,T094,T093,5,0,60,1.05,other/bass,drums/vocals/other,riff,no, pitch shifted up a semitone
S057,T090,T093,0,0,150,1.08,drums,drums/bass/other/vocals,beat,no, half of the samples used in S054 and S55
S058,T095,T093,138,0,40,1.21,other/bass/drums,other/bass/drums/vocals,riff,no, it seems that bass and drums are removed from query or at least covered
S060,T098,T097,0,8,204,1.08,drums,vocals/other/bass,beat,no, pretty short but ok. Doesn't really sound the same between ref and sample tracks?
S061,T098,T099,0,11,150,1.0,drums,bass/vocals/other,beat,no, Pretty short only full cycles counted. Extra bass drum note in sample in sample track
S062,T098,T100,0,5,100,0.97,drums,bass/vocals/other,beat,no, pretty short but ok. Extra bass drum notes in sample in sample track
S063,T101,T102,1,0,24,1.02,drums/bass/other,vocals,riff,no, pitch shifted up
S064,T104,T103,1,15,96,1.07,drums,bass/vocals/other,beat,no, Beat appears to run through entire track except start and end but volume is much quieter in some sections
S067,T108,T109,6,54,114,1.0,drums/other,vocals/other,beat,no, the second half of the song has a completely different beat which is not the same sample so I have noted this as absence of beat although I think the original study seemed to count this section incorrectly?
S068,T111,T110,0,15,55,1.02,drums/vocals/other,bass/vocals/other,riff,no, pitch shifted up. Pattern in sample track is – sample played 1.5 times (3 bars) then 1 bar of two repeating notes from sample
S069,T112,T110,14,0,1,1.02,drums/bass/vocals,vocals,riff,no, quite clean actually
S071,T116,T115,88,7,82,0.85,drums/bass,vocals,beat,no, pretty distorted final drums - might have overlapping
S072,T117,T115,1,60,7,0.93,drums/other,vocals,riff,no, 
S073,T119,T118,5,0,139,0.78,drums,bass/other/vocals,beat,no, 
S074,T085,T121,1,0,74,1.05,drums,vocals/other/bass,beat,no, Perhaps chopped with compression or gated reverb: different timbre; yet accurate pattern. this was originally marked as interpolation I'm pretty sure it isnt
S078,T145,T144,12,39,2,1.12,drums/other,drums,riff,no, ref track annotates full bar - both examples in sample track are different lengths but just under one bar
S079,T145,T146,1,0,22,1.04,drums,vocals/other,beat,no, 
S080,T148,T147,18,5,24,0.81,bass/drums/other,drums/vocals,riff,no, the original drums have been erased or covered
S081,T148,T149,18,13,15,0.93,bass/drums/other,vocals/other,riff,no, end of loop doubled (not counted). pitch shifted down. final note of sample is extended between occurrences but this is not counted in initial study
S082,T151,T150,6,114,7,1.0,bass/drums,drums/vocals,riff,no, extremely short
S083,T145,T152,3,56,28,1.08,drums,vocals/other,beat,no, hi-hat has been covered or removed from drums
S084,T154,T153,18,0,54,1.0,bass/drums/other,vocals/drums/other,riff,no, LF. pitch shift down. Notes are different from ref track to sample track?
S086,T154,T157,1,1,9,1.0,bass/other,vocals,riff,no, intro
S089,T160,T157,0,64,8,0.97,other/drums,bass/vocals,riff,no, pitch shifted. Initial study categorized the riff as one bar but the slight variation of notes leads me to believe it is a full 4 bar sample which is repeated in full once and in half-length twice
S091,T162,T163,0,17,3,1.0,drums,bass/vocals/other,beat,probably, HF only and soft. Very hard to detect. Very faint sample and heavily filtered so not sure about accuracy of this one
S092,T162,T164,8,7,53,0.97,drums/other,vocals/other,riff,no, 
S094,T167,T166,6,15,43,1.0,bass/drums/other,drums/vocals/other,riff,no, Bass + synth. L1 samples bass only - L2 samples bass + synth (ref and sample tracks). Not 100% sure what was annotated in the original study
S098,T173,T172,108,5,71,1.0,other/drums,drums/bass/other/vocals,riff,no, Very faint in places but sample appears to run through most of the track
S101,T177,T176,0,0,27,1.0,bass/drums,vocals/drums/other,riff,no, 4 separate sections annotated in ref track – these form the beat but occur in somewhat random orders through the sample track
S103,T180,T179,1,1,12,1.0,drums/other,vocals/other/bass/drums,riff,no, for some reason source separation algorithms detect the trumpets as vocals 
S104,T182,T181,0,0,99,1.19,bass/drums/other,vocals,riff,no, 
S106,T185,T184,0,135,8,0.91,other,drums/vocals/other,riff,no, Original study annotates this as separate one-bar occurrences but I think it is one long sample because of the way the vocals overlap between bars – the two different vocals mean the sampled section in the ref track must be at least 2 bars long in any case
S107,T083,T184,321,137,7,0.95,drums/bass/other,vocals/other,beat,no, tiny piece of bass and guitar at the start of beat 
S109,T160,T187,0,9,77,0.93,drums/other,drums/vocals/other,riff,no, might be 39 n_repetitions (the study wasn't sure whether the sample is 2 bars or 4 bars)
S112,T088,T187,1,0,21,1.0,drums,vocals/other,beat,no, the sample has been created by joining different segments of the ref track
S113,T083,T189,321,137,4,0.98,drums/vocals/other,vocals,beat,no, (might be 2 n_repetitions) Initial study was unsure if 4x 1 bar samples or 2x 2 bar samples in sample track – it is 2x 2 bar samples evidenced by brief guitar note at beginning of 2 bar segment
S114,T083,T190,321,0,102,1.06,drums/vocals/other,other/vocals,beat,no, L1 is original 1 bar sample as identified in original study. L2 gives a potentially better example of the 1 bar sample as it does not contain the guitar note at the beginning of the bar
S115,T083,T191,321,11,112,1.02,drums/vocals/other,bass/vocals/other,beat,no, Ref track same as S114 – L1 indicates original annotation (L2 is arguably a "better" annotation)
S116,T193,T192,106,5,75,1.0,drums,bass/vocals/other,beat,no, Beginnings . In ref track – sample is a 2 bar section which does not occur in full in sample track. The sample heard in the sample track appears to consist of 1x L1 from ref track + 2x L2 from ref track
S120,T199,T184,5,2,71,1.0,bass/drums/other,vocals,riff,no, 
S121,T064,T065,2,0,12,1.37,bass/drums/other,vocals,riff,no, the intro/refrain riff. Ref track – timestamp in initial study was wrong – actually starts where I've annotated.
S122,T072,T073,4,32,5,0.96,other/drums/bass,other/vocals,riff,no, brass part
S123,T062,T063,59,49,44,1.0,other,bass/vocals/drums/other,riff,yes, verse (very soft). I think they refer to the guitar riff - but it sounds like an interpolation or an extremely short clip that is repeated. Two major issues – between the ref track and sample track - the vocal is removed and the guitar chord rhythm is different. The timestamp on the initial study does not seem to correspond to anything – just two guitar chords which are not really heard in the sample track in isolation. I think this has been rerecorded so this one might be best to leave out of the study
S124,T052,T051,1,13,80,1.0,drums,bass/vocals/other,beat,no, only the measures with double BD counted. sample consists of 2x L1 and 2x L2 on loop. See 029
S125,T042,T041,7,12,16,1.26,bass/other,bass/vocals/drums,riff,no, the guitar + strings bar
S126,T038,T037,4,52,10,1.0,bass/other,bass/drums,riff,no, the guitar + brass bar
S127,T031,T030,46,13,43,1.0,other,vocals/drums,riff,no, end of loop
S128,T029,T028,5,27,4,1.0,bass/drums/vocals/other,drums/vocals,riff,no, 10 sec refrain
S129,T023,T022,11,84,2,1.26,bass/drums/other,bass/drums/vocals,riff,yes, saxophone. Big variation between ref and sample track due to interpolation – might not be worth keeping
S130,T014,T013,68,0,1,1.05,drums/bass/other,vocals,riff,no, intro not interpolated
S131,T003,T004,23,20,9,1.0,bass/drums,vocals,riff,no, repeated beat (of which 3 included in S2)
S134,T167,T166,2,25,14,1.0,bass/drums/other,vocals/drums,riff,no, Just bass - the other sample is covered in S094. New annotations contain both samples within S094
S135,T199,T184,14,58,3,0.97,bass/other/drums,vocals/other,riff,no, brass riff
S136,T199,T184,66,0,2,1.0,other/drums,vocals/drums/other/bass,riff,no, brass crescendo
S137,T173,T172,1,44,14,1.0,bass/drums/other,vocals,riff,no,
